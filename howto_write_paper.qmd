# Writing papers

## How to write a scientific paper once we decide that you have one or more interesting results

*Start by discussing with me what the paper is about!*

### Figures and Tables

-   Create a draft of your ideal set of *Figures* & *Tables* (in addition to supplements) that can tell an interesting, coherent story.
    -   Write detailed figure/table legends to help understand what piece of the story each figure/table will convey.
    -   Get feedback on the entire story draft from colleagues / collaborators / committee.
    -   Based on these interactions, keep revisiting & revising this draft.

### Introduction & Discussion

-   Read widely and deeply. Read often.
    -   Remember that this exercise is going to entirely feed your *Introduction and Discussion* sections.
    -   Record all the papers in a *Zotero* library, starting with Slack shares and periodic PubMed searches.
    -   Create a single *Google Doc and make notes about each paper* along with its title & link. The purpose of the notes is to make the points you will write in your manuscript to cite each paper.
    -   Based on these readings and discussions during project meetings, *pick a target journal*.

### Supplementary data

-   Make all main and supplemental *Figures and Tables* along with declarative titles & detailed legends.
    -   Run many controls and sanity checks.
    -   Rapidly iterate with me & colleagues and do additional analyses needed to fill gaps & round-out the story.
    -   Prepare for & do code review.

### Methods & Code+Data

-   Write a very detailed *Methods* section and prepare *Code & Data* to be released.
    -   Decide (w/ me) what *Code & Data* need to be released with this manuscript.
    -   As you write each sub-section of *Methods*, organize and document the pertinent code, data, and results.

### Results

-   Write the *Results* section and rapidly iterate with me & colleagues to make changes/improvements.

### Tying them together

-   Start with the story line.
-   Make the Figures/Tables (you will keep iterating over these until submission).
-   Write the Methods since that's the easiest one to tackle.
-   Then, write the Results describing your Figs/Tables.
-   Finally, write the *Introduction and Discussion* sections, and add *References* (*e.g.,* Zotero + Google Docs integration).
    -   The Introduction section should lead up to the main questions and results of the manuscript.
    -   The Discussion should put the new results in the context of existing work, describe novelty & potential impact, and conclude with opportunities for future work.
    -   Perform any additional analyses/comparisons needed to make these sections airtight.

### Title & Abstract

-   Write *Title and Abstract*, and get feedback from me/colleagues/collaborators on this full document.

### Last Steps

-   While others are critically reviewing the manuscript:
    -   Create a well-organized & documented companion *GitHub repo* for the manuscript.
        -   This should contain all the *Code & Data* (from Step 4) that will be publicly released.
    -   Write the *Cover Letter*.
-   Submit on bioRxiv, share on social media, and submit to journal! ðŸŽ‰

## Resources

> Much has already been written on how to think about and go about writing good papers. This doc contains pointers to great resources on these aspects.

#### Getting Started -- General Thoughts and Principles

1.  [How to write a first-class paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02404-4) -- Six experts offer advice on producing a manuscript that will get published and pull in readers.
2.  [Ten Simple Rules for Writing Research Papers](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003453) -- Principles and attitude that can help guide the process of writing in particular and research in general.

#### Writing the Paper -- Sections and Structure

1.  The [CommKit](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/use-the-commkit/) is a collection of guides to successful communication in the biological sciences. It contains an entire section on writing Journal Articles with annotated real-world examples. Highly recommended!
2.

#### Nailing Key Sections and Fine-tuning

1.  [The 5 pivotal paragraphs in a paper](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/the-5-pivotal-paragraphs-in-a-paper/) -- There are five really pivotal paragraphs in any paper. If you get those five paragraphs right, you are likely to have and communicate the story arc in a way that grabs attention.
2.  [How to write paragraphs in research texts](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/writingforresearch/2017/07/17/how-to-write-paragraphs-in-research-texts-articles-books-and-phds/) -- Essay on crafting solid paragraphs.
