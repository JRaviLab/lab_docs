## Mission, Expectations, Conduct, Support
### Mission
We value and believe in investing in and nurturing scientists as much as the science.
We pride ourselves on providing a safe and inclusive space for people across intersectionalities.
We are committed to mentoring (postdocs, students, programmers), education and outreach, and personalized professional development.
We are passionate about finding ways to increase diversity and retention in STEM and quantitative sciences.
If you share our passion, please [reach out to us](//jravilab.github.io/joinus)!

### Roles and expectations
## PI

### Mentoring philosophy


## Postdocs
As a postdoctoral researcher, you wear many hats in addition to those of more junior scientists in the lab.

-   A postdoctoral position is a training opportunity -- you are here to learn new skills and expand your scientific boundaries. You are not expected to know everything, but you should be comfortable (and preferably excited!) throwing yourself into new problems and solving them.
-   You are also here to help others learn. Postdocs have considerable experience in many aspects typically involving academia, research, and more. That experience can be very helpful for scientists who are earlier in their own careers. Contribute generously where you can, and make yourself available for ohers in the group. A rising tide lifts all boats.
-   You may work on a number of existing projects across the lab, either leading them or helping each team navigate research obstacles. Postdocs have already had experience troubleshooting their way through their work in the past, and are expected to be able to leverage that experience by operating more independently. Some projects you work on might be new and higher risk, and some might be stalled and in need of a fresh perspective.
-   In addition, postdocs are strongly encouraged to pursue their own independent research interests along paths related to the work we do. For projects that succeed, they should have "future directions" that a postdoc can take forward into their own, independent careers in the future.
-   Grant writing is a crucial aspect of a postdoc's job. It both funds your position and your research where possible, and most critically, gives you practice and experience seeking and applying for funding opportunities needed for launching into independent faculty positions.
-   Communicating science is extremely important, be it through manuscripts, conference presentations, or workshops. Expect to keep busy presenting the work you do to others, and use the experience to get your name out there and network!
-   Finding your next step is the ultimate goal of your position. For all the roles you have, they should help focus your skillset, your CV, and open future opportunties for you to move onwards and upwards towards where you want to end up in life.

## Code of conduct
### Overview:
There is zero tolerance for harassment or discrimination in the Ravi Lab and at the University of Colorado. These are forms of abuse, and they create a workplace environment that can leave people feeling unsafe and unwelcome. Members of the Ravi Lab come from many different backgrounds, and this diversity is one of our greatest strengths. 

While this is not exhaustive, examples of unacceptable behaviors include harassment, discrimination, or other unwanted behaviors, verbal or physical, that make others uncomfortable, both at and outside work. This applies to conduct in public or on social media, not just at the job. Protected categories include but are not limited to gender identity and sexuality, physical appearance, size, weight, and disability (of all types), race, ethnic group, age, and religion. These topics are covered in part by the required training modules you will take after employment at the University of Colorado. 

You can review the policies from the Office of Equity’s Discrimination and Harassment page [here](https://www.ucdenver.edu/offices/equity/university-policies-procedures/discrimination-and-harassment), and from the Anschutz Medical Campus’ office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Community Engagement [here](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/diversity-equity-inclusion-community/resources/policies). 

We recognize that because of our diverse backgrounds, our experiences with what conduct is considered appropriate may vary, and similarly, no-one should feel afraid to be themselves out of fear of violating an unspoken rule. Instead, it is our collective responsibility to educate each other. If we see or hear conduct that is inappropriate, whether it is targeted at us or other individuals or groups, each of us must commit to calling that behavior out. A joke in poor taste alone won’t get anyone terminated, but a pattern of misconduct despite being told it is inappropriate, arguing back or justification of misconduct when asked to avoid such behaviors, or severe misconduct are grounds for discipline. 

If you are unsure what constitutes acceptable behavior and where the line is drawn, talk to us! These rules are important, but they are also a socially determined set of boundaries – they are not universally known and universally evident, and it is our collective responsibility to help each other understand what the boundaries are and how to steer safely clear of them. Similarly, if you feel like a comment or behavior might be inappropriate, you do not need to have a justification for feeling upset, you do not need to seek second opinions from others, and you do not need to observe the behavior repeatedly for it to be a problem – all of our individual boundaries, personalities, and histories are what define the rules, and your voice is important. You should always feel comfortable speaking up, especially if you are a lone voice!

If you observe or are the recipient of discrimination, sexual misconduct, or harassment, reports should be made to the Office of Equity. [You can read about this process here]( https://www.ucdenver.edu/offices/equity/resolutions/make-a-report). Depending on your classification, [you may be a mandatory reporter of misconduct](https://www.ucdenver.edu/offices/equity/resolutions/who-is-required-to-report), meaning you must report any such misconduct you observe.

## Professional Conduct:
Details on responsible science, authorship, and the expectations of your role are found throughout this document. Generally speaking, as a member of the Ravi Lab, you are a professional researcher, and you can and should take pride in this. We are better for your membership! With this role comes certain responsibilities that go beyond the code of conduct overview mentioned above. Remember that your behaviors represent the lab, all of our research, and even Anschutz and the University of Colorado at large. Treat our fellow scientists in other labs and the general public with respect and understanding, try to avoid being drawn into public arguments on social media (nobody wins these), always be open to learning and re-learning, and do not let ego cloud judgement. Academia has its problems, and even if the opportunity presents itself, we should not seek to use or diminish others merely to climb a career ladder. 

As a group, our success and reputation, and the quality of our science and its positive impacts on society all depend on our lab having a sense of social cohesion and [psychological safety]( https://www.hbs.edu/recruiting/insights-and-advice/blog/post/how-to-create-a-psychologically-safe-workplace). This goal is aspirational and does not materialize automatically, but with our collective efforts and daily upkeep, is very attainable.

## Publication, Authorship & Research Misconduct
### Publishing

To quote the Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society, Dr. Mark Walport, ["Science isn't finished until it's communicated."](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2013/10/03/science-is-not-finished-until-its-communicated-uk-chief-scientist/) If work isn't documented, written up, peer-reviewed, and made publicly available, it's no different than if the work hadn't been performed in the first place. For our group, that might involve writing clearly commented, clean code, submitting it for code reviews, and sharing it through GitHub, or it could involve writing a manuscript and submitting it to scientific journals. In any case, it is imperative to work towards sharing [reproducible, repeatable, and replicable science.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778115/)

### Authorship

It's often said that publications and citations are the [currency of science](https://socialsciences.nature.com/posts/54635-publication-a-universal-currency-in-academia). How does one become an author on a paper? What even is a paper? When is a project ready to publish? Many of these questions are best answered through conversations with peers and collaborators, but there are resources available to help provide context.

- A paper, a publication, a manuscript, or whatever you might hear it called is a formal write-up of a scientific project. It typically follows a format referred to as [IMRAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD) for Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. These refer to the order of [sections of the paper](https://ori.hhs.gov/content/Chapter-9-Authorship-and-Publication-Responsible-publication), which roughly presents the introduction to the problem or knowledge gap, the methodological approach or techniques the authors decided to use to address the issue established in the introduction, what the results and data outputs of those methods are, and the interpretation of those findings and how they relate back to the problem established at the start. While the exact formatting varies journal-to-journal, this structure generally captures [how scientific results are written and reported.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC442179/)

- Having your name on a paper's author list typically requires a [substantial intellectual contribution.](https://ori.hhs.gov/content/Chapter-9-Authorship-and-Publication-Authorship) Without your work, the story in the manuscript would not have been complete. Typically, the position of the authors in the list reflects the amount of credit they deserve for the work done, and the PI(s) who oversaw the project receive(s) the last author position(s) to signify that it was their lab(s) who performed the work. Many people make minor contributions that do not make the cut for the author list, and they may earn a space in an Acknowledgements section. Discussions about project responsibilities and the positions contributors will earn on a manuscript should happen early and often. The details of this vary from field to field and lab to lab, but a good overview can be found [in this article, interviewing many different scientists across disciplines.](https://www.science.org/content/article/how-navigate-authorship-scientific-manuscripts).

- What kinds of contributions are important? Researchers have asked this question enough times to lead to the creation of a framework called [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/) for Contributor Roles Taxonomy. While this isn't the final say on what types of contributions there can be on a manuscript, many journals have adopted the CRediT system to specifically assign which authors contributed in what ways in a paper, so it's definitely worth a look. 

- What does it mean if you're an author? No matter your position in the author list, it means you are literally assigning your name to work performed. Even if you only worked on one small part of the analysis, you must be familiar with all aspects of the paper. Your authorship is a statement that you vouch for the content, the methods, and the conclusions made in the paper. While honest mistakes do happen and can slip through to publication, all authors should do their best to ensure everything was conducted to the highest standards for scientific rigor. Mistakes that significantly change the interpretation or outcome of an experiment, or worse, intentionally misleading or fraudulent data, can seriously affect or even end scientific careers for authors on erroneous papers. Authorship should be taken seriously because contributing to the larger body of scientific knowledge can and does have real impacts on the world and lives in it. 

### Research Misconduct

- If you are concerned about misconduct by fellow scientists, talk to them first! Science is inherently collaborative, and everybody brings a unique perspective -- you may notice something that others have missed, and simply asking about it can course-correct a project. If you don't feel satisfied with the answers, or if a researcher is not acting in good faith, it is your responsibility to [report potential misconduct](https://www.colorado.edu/researchinnovation/rcr/research-misconduct). In cases where you aren't certain but still have concerns, you can speak with a Research Integrity Officer at CU and discuss whether the issue qualifies as misconduct before escalating to a formal report.
