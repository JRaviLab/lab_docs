# Lab culture

## Mission, Expectations, Conduct, Support
### Mission
We value and believe in investing in and nurturing scientists as much as the science.
We pride ourselves on providing a safe and inclusive space for people across intersectionalities.
We are committed to mentoring (postdocs, students, programmers), education and outreach, and personalized professional development.
We are passionate about finding new, better ways to increase diversity and retention in STEM and quantitative sciences.
If you share our passion, please [reach out to us](//jravilab.github.io/joinus)!

### Roles and expectations
## PI
My role as a PI would be to ensure your growth and success as a trainee, and the success of the project. Towards this, I will <br>
- serve as a sounding board for all your ideas. You will have the freedom to work on your best ideas broadly aligned with the lab's vision and you will always find in me an audience to discuss and brainstorm.
- help outline and plan your project(s) and design appropriate analyses.
- check-in with you once a semester as you plan your time, and more regularly to ensure you're on track -- based on the professional, scientific, and personal goals you've set for yourself.
- provide resources to develop your research program and technical skills as you plan the next stage of your career (e.g., PRA --> grad school, PhD student --> postdoc/industry, postdoc --> PI/research lead).
- help you with scientific communication (reading, writing grants and papers, presenting) and provide ample opportunities to engage and network at national meetings.
- connect you with potential collaborators and mentors for scientific and professional growth and reciprocity. Team science is one of several skills you will learn during your tenure with us -- you will learn to communicate effectively not just with other computational colleagues but with the admin, grants, and scientific writing teams, experimental and clinical collaborators.
- create a diverse and inclusive safe space for all intersectionalities in the lab to ensure everyone thrives scientifically, professionally, and personally while respecting and supporting their colleagues.
- enable you to pay forward by creating inclusive communities through scientific and technical education and outreach reach opportunities (e.g., R-Ladies, AsiaR, WiSTEM, SACNAS).

### Mentoring Philosophy | [full_post](https://github.com/JRaviLab/group/blob/main/docs/mentoring_philosophy.md)
My experiences as a mentee have varied widely: fantastic professors in college inspired me to start a research career; later, a mentor overlooked my whole dissertation work resulting in prolonged authorship discussion. In my postdoctoral lab, I was the sole computational researcher collaborating with a dozen experimental biologists. I seized this invaluable opportunity to restart my academic career from scratch in a different field (i.e., studying microbial diseases), to learn, understand, and speak the language of both experimental and computational biologists, and to bring these worlds together. Collectively, these experiences have shaped my mentoring philosophy.

- _Opening doors and leveling the playing field_ (i.e., not gate-keeping)
- _Lives bigger than work_
- _Collaborative mentoring_ (i.e., not top-down advising)
- _Mentoring is not imprinting_

### Inclusive lab climate | [full_post](https://github.com/JRaviLab/group/blob/main/docs/mentoring_philosophy.md)
I have mentored 15+ diverse undergraduate and graduate students. Several joined my lab as first-time coders and have co-authored computational papers; five have contributed to submitted manuscripts (see Bibliography). All these students have had positive research experiences, presented at (inter-)national conferences, and won awards/support from national programs, including NIH-funded BRUSH, NSF-funded REU-ACRES, SROP, and NSURP. Several undergraduate trainees have graduated and started advanced studies at prestigious graduate and medical schools or jobs at pharmaceutical/IT companies. Using lessons learned from these experiences, I will focus on the following key areas to ensure an equitable and inclusive lab climate.

- _Recruiting practices_ - e.g., working with the Offices of Inclusion/Diversity, R/Py-Ladies, W+DS, and online groups for minorities in STEM (e.g., Black in Computational Biology, LatinR, AfricaR, AsiaR, ArabR, RainbowR).
- _Safe space for full participation_ - for people from all intersectionalities, zero tolerance to discriminatory or exclusionary behavior, appropriate pronoun usage, sustain a culture rooted in mutual respect.
- _Empowering mentees to forge their path_ - e.g., co-developing semester plans, conducting professional development workshops within the lab, creating networking opportunities through local/national/international meetings, and tailoring mentoring strategies to each mentee’s career aspirations.

## Postdocs
As a postdoctoral researcher, you wear many hats besides those of more junior scientists in the lab.

- A postdoctoral position is a training opportunity -- you are here to learn new skills and expand your scientific boundaries. You are not expected to know everything, but you should be comfortable (and preferably excited!) throwing yourself into new problems and solving them.
- You are also here to help others learn. Postdocs have considerable experience in many aspects, typically involving academia, research, and more. That experience can be beneficial for scientists who are earlier in their careers. Contribute generously where you can, and make yourself available for others in the group. A rising tide lifts all boats.
- You may work on several existing projects across the lab -- either leading them or helping each team navigate research obstacles. Postdocs have already had experience troubleshooting their way through their work in the past, and are expected to be able to leverage that experience by operating more independently. Some projects you work on might be new and higher risk, and some might be stalled and in need of a fresh perspective.
- In addition, postdocs are strongly encouraged to pursue their independent research interests aligned with the group's research interests. For projects that succeed, they should have "future directions" they can take forward into their independent careers in the future.
- Grant writing is a crucial aspect of a postdoc's job. It funds your position and research where possible and, most critically, gives you practice and experience seeking and applying for funding opportunities needed for launching into independent faculty positions.
- Communicating science is a fundamental and essential part of this role, be it through manuscripts, conference presentations, or workshops. Expect to keep busy presenting your work at regional and (inter)national platforms, and use the experience to get your name out there and network!
- Finding your next step is the ultimate goal of your position. For all the roles you have, they should help focus your skillset, CV, and open future opportunities for you to move onwards and upwards towards where you want to end up in life.

## Code of conduct
### Overview:
There is zero tolerance for harassment or discrimination in the Ravi Lab and at the University of Colorado. These are forms of abuse, and they create a workplace environment that can leave people feeling unsafe and unwelcome. Members of the Ravi Lab come from many different backgrounds, and this diversity is one of our greatest strengths. 

While this is not exhaustive, examples of unacceptable behaviors include harassment, discrimination, or other unwanted behaviors, verbal or physical, that make others uncomfortable, both at and outside work. This applies to conduct in public or on social media, not just at the job. Protected categories include but are not limited to gender identity and sexuality, physical appearance, size, weight, and disability (of all types), race, ethnic group, age, and religion. These topics are covered in part by the required training modules you will take after employment at the University of Colorado. 

You can review the policies from the Office of Equity’s Discrimination and Harassment page [here](https://www.ucdenver.edu/offices/equity/university-policies-procedures/discrimination-and-harassment), and from the Anschutz Medical Campus’ office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Community Engagement [here](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/diversity-equity-inclusion-community/resources/policies). 

We recognize that because of our diverse backgrounds, our experiences with what conduct is considered appropriate may vary, and similarly, no-one should feel afraid to be themselves out of fear of violating an unspoken rule. Instead, it is our collective responsibility to educate each other. If we see or hear conduct that is inappropriate, whether it is targeted at us or other individuals or groups, each of us must commit to calling that behavior out. A joke in poor taste alone won’t get anyone terminated, but a pattern of misconduct despite being told it is inappropriate, arguing back or justification of misconduct when asked to avoid such behaviors, or severe misconduct are grounds for discipline. 

If you are unsure what constitutes acceptable behavior and where the line is drawn, talk to us! These rules are important, but they are also a socially determined set of boundaries – they are not universally known and universally evident, and it is our collective responsibility to help each other understand what the boundaries are and how to steer safely clear of them. Similarly, if you feel like a comment or behavior might be inappropriate, you do not need to have a justification for feeling upset, you do not need to seek second opinions from others, and you do not need to observe the behavior repeatedly for it to be a problem – all of our individual boundaries, personalities, and histories are what define the rules, and your voice is important. You should always feel comfortable speaking up, especially if you are a lone voice!

If you observe or are the recipient of discrimination, sexual misconduct, or harassment, reports should be made to the Office of Equity. [You can read about this process here]( https://www.ucdenver.edu/offices/equity/resolutions/make-a-report). Depending on your classification, [you may be a mandatory reporter of misconduct](https://www.ucdenver.edu/offices/equity/resolutions/who-is-required-to-report), meaning you must report any such misconduct you observe.

## Professional Conduct:
Details on responsible science, authorship, and the expectations of your role are found throughout this document. Generally speaking, as a member of the Ravi Lab, you are a professional researcher, and you can and should take pride in this. We are better for your membership! With this role comes certain responsibilities that go beyond the code of conduct overview mentioned above. Remember that your behaviors represent the lab, all of our research, and even Anschutz and the University of Colorado at large. Treat our fellow scientists in other labs and the general public with respect and understanding, try to avoid being drawn into public arguments on social media (nobody wins these), always be open to learning and re-learning, and do not let ego cloud judgement. Academia has its problems, and if the opportunity presents itself, we should never seek to use or diminish others merely to climb a career ladder. 

As a group, our success and reputation, and the quality of our science and its positive impacts on society all depend on our lab having a sense of social cohesion and [psychological safety]( https://www.hbs.edu/recruiting/insights-and-advice/blog/post/how-to-create-a-psychologically-safe-workplace). This goal is aspirational and does not materialize automatically, but with our collective efforts and daily upkeep, is very attainable.

## Lab Proceedings
### Meetings and formats
Lab meetings are divided into a few formats. 

- Weekly lab meetings provide a space for everyone to share updates and roadblocks, and depending on the needs of the group, these meetings can be in a roundtable format where everybody who has updates can share them briefly (<10min per person), longer form updates or presentations for 1-2 people (<30min per person), or the entire slot can be reserved so one person can give a practice talk or major project summaries (<60min per person). We operate a Google Calendar where members can put themselves down for specific topics, times, and dates. In all cases, these weekly lab meetings are required for all members to attend.
- Weekly project-specific meetings give lab members under a broadly shared project/topic umbrella a space for more detailed discussions and to seek specific feedback and help from their peers in the same or similar topics. These meetings are only required for those in the relevant associated projects, but are open to any members curious to sit in, learn, and  contribute. Like the weekly lab meetings, lab members can schedule themselves for specific topics or times. Because of their more focused scope, there may be times where these meetings can be quick updates dropped in Slack instead, and all involved lab members should communicate regularly to ensure each meeting is necessary.
- One-on-one meetings or small group meetings can be scheduled as-needed, either with Janani or others. 
- Journal club or technical primers serve as opportunities to present interesting new research papers from other groups, or to give practice teaching a topic by sharing how-to or tutorial lectures on topics of your choosing. For journal clubs, all members of the lab must read the selected paper ahead of time and be prepared to help their peers explain it. Likewise, to be respectful of the time commitments of others, the presenter must share their selected paper at least a few days before the meeting, and preferably the week before to give everyone a chance to read it thoroughly. The format of journal club is largely up to the presenter, but it should walk briefly through the background to the problem, the question or need the paper addresses, how they did the work, what the results were, and how it ties back to the larger problems in the field and future directions. While the presenter can take the lead and walk the group through everything, journal clubs are a lot more engaging and educational with participation, so having the audience explain figures and interpretations is an easy way to ensure people are learning instead of just listening.

Meetings are almost always held in-person, but are held in a hybrid format with Zoom. While it's strongly encouraged for members to attend whenever possible in-person, remote attendance is an option. If you do plan on joining meetings remotely, please communicate this via Slack ahead of time when possible (with our collective understanding that emergencies arise), and you must still make an effort to actively participate. Mid-workday naps are okay, but please don't schedule them during meetings! Finally, for members attending meetings in-person, don't forget any people online -- make an effort to involve remote participants too, including actively soliciting feedback or checking in. It can be difficult for members in a Zoom call to find a good moment to interrupt a conversation happening in the room, so try to be aware of the limits of the format and make everyone feel welcome and included.

### Communication
- Communication within the group \| [Slack](https://jravilab.slack.com "JRaviLab Slack Workspace") \| In-person/Zoom co-work

In all meetings and interactions, it is imperative that lab members are constructive in feedback and respectful of each other. Critiques are always welcome and encouraged, but they should be supportive and aimed at building others up and improving our science, not tearing others down. At the same time, we shouldn't shy away from providing critical feedback! As scientists, we all need regular practice critically analyzing and interpreting what we read and hear, and a friendly environment like our lab group is the best place to work on these skills together. 

### Remote work & working hours
At a very broad level, the more time you put into your work, the more you’ll get accomplished. However, this is also an obvious oversimplification. Some people prefer a typical 9-5, others thrive with a 10 hour/4 day workweek, and others still find their productivity falls off after 6 hours of work. Adding to this, our work can often be asynchronous, and working remotely can be integrated into a routine as well.

Generally speaking, if you are meeting milestones, participating in project and group discussions, and comfortable with your work-life balance in our lab, the details of your work schedule are flexible. For a diverse group, a schedule that accommodates everyone necessarily requires compromise. Your exact schedule will come down to your role in the lab, your preferences, and the group’s availability. There are some basic rules and tenants to be aware of.

### Hours

For full-time members (e.g., PRAs, postdocs, grads), expect to put in 40 hours of work per week on average. 

For part-time members (e.g., undergraduates during the semester, interns, and other volunteers), you might be in the range of 10-30 hours a week typically.

These ranges are estimates, and will vary across people and over time. We never want to find ourselves in a crunch, but deadlines sometimes do pile up, and some weeks may require more hours. At the same time, some weeks will be lighter, breaks are encouraged, and working to the clock, or overtime should not be glorified either. Most importantly, maintain a comfortable work-life balance that leaves you wanting to come back for more, and keeps you far from the burnout line! If you ever feel stressed about your schedule/workload, talk to your PI & group to see how we can change things.

[Presenteeism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15559575/) isn’t a healthy mindset, and health and productivity rank ahead (in that order!) of simply being present.

### Leave policy

-   For staff: The University of Colorado's [leave policies are available here](https://www.cu.edu/employee-services/leave-policies).
-   For graduate students: Details may vary per your specific graduate program's handbook, but [the Graduate School offers basic guidelines here](https://www.ucdenver.edu/docs/librariesprovider138/denver-anschutz-graduate-school/resources/gs-student-leavevacpolicy.pdf?sfvrsn=661c22b9_2). 
-   Because our group is tightly collaborative, please plan non-sick leave ahead of time to best fit all schedules when possible.

## Publication, Authorship & Research Misconduct
### Publishing

To quote the Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society, Dr. Mark Walport, ["Science isn't finished until it's communicated."](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2013/10/03/science-is-not-finished-until-its-communicated-uk-chief-scientist/) If work isn't documented, written up, peer-reviewed, and made publicly available, it's no different than if the work hadn't been performed in the first place. For our group, that might involve writing clearly commented, clean code, submitting it for code reviews, and sharing it through GitHub, or it could involve writing a manuscript and submitting it to scientific journals. In any case, it is imperative to work towards sharing [reproducible, repeatable, and replicable science.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778115/)

### Authorship

It's often said that publications and citations are the [currency of science](https://socialsciences.nature.com/posts/54635-publication-a-universal-currency-in-academia). How does one become an author on a paper? What even is a paper? When is a project ready to publish? Many of these questions are best answered through conversations with peers and collaborators, but there are resources available to help provide context.

- A paper, a publication, a manuscript, or whatever you might hear it called is a formal write-up of a scientific project. It typically follows a format referred to as [IMRAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD) for Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. These refer to the order of [sections of the paper](https://ori.hhs.gov/content/Chapter-9-Authorship-and-Publication-Responsible-publication), which roughly presents the introduction to the problem or knowledge gap, the methodological approach or techniques the authors decided to use to address the issue established in the introduction, what the results and data outputs of those methods are, and the interpretation of those findings and how they relate back to the problem established at the start. While the exact formatting varies journal-to-journal, this structure generally captures [how scientific results are written and reported.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC442179/)

- Having your name on a paper's author list typically requires a [substantial intellectual contribution.](https://ori.hhs.gov/content/Chapter-9-Authorship-and-Publication-Authorship) Without your work, the story in the manuscript would not have been complete. Typically, the position of the authors in the list reflects the amount of credit they deserve for the work done, and the PI(s) who oversaw the project receive(s) the last author position(s) to signify that it was their lab(s) who performed the work. Many people make minor contributions that do not make the cut for the author list, and they may earn a space in an Acknowledgements section. Discussions about project responsibilities and the positions contributors will earn on a manuscript should happen early and often. The details of this vary from field to field and lab to lab, but a good overview can be found [in this article, interviewing many different scientists across disciplines.](https://www.science.org/content/article/how-navigate-authorship-scientific-manuscripts).

- What kinds of contributions are important? Researchers have asked this question enough times to lead to the creation of a framework called [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/) for Contributor Roles Taxonomy. While this isn't the final say on what types of contributions there can be on a manuscript, many journals have adopted the CRediT system to specifically assign which authors contributed in what ways in a paper, so it's definitely worth a look. 

- What does it mean if you're an author? No matter your position in the author list, it means you are literally assigning your name to work performed. Even if you only worked on one small part of the analysis, you must be familiar with all aspects of the paper. Your authorship is a statement that you vouch for the content, the methods, and the conclusions made in the paper. While honest mistakes do happen and can slip through to publication, all authors should do their best to ensure everything was conducted to the highest standards for scientific rigor. Mistakes that significantly change the interpretation or outcome of an experiment, or worse, intentionally misleading or fraudulent data, can seriously affect or even end scientific careers for authors on erroneous papers. Authorship should be taken seriously because contributing to the larger body of scientific knowledge can and does have real impacts on the world and lives in it. 

### Research Misconduct

- If you are concerned about misconduct by fellow scientists, talk to them first! Science is inherently collaborative, and everybody brings a unique perspective -- you may notice something that others have missed, and simply asking about it can course-correct a project. If you don't feel satisfied with the answers, or if a researcher is not acting in good faith, it is your responsibility to [report potential misconduct](https://www.colorado.edu/researchinnovation/rcr/research-misconduct). In cases where you aren't certain but still have concerns, you can speak with a Research Integrity Officer at CU and discuss whether the issue qualifies as misconduct before escalating to a formal report.
