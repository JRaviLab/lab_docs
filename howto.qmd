# How to X

## Get started

If you are new to computational biology and R programming, join the `#bioinfo-primers` channel. Use the `#help-x` channels to ask for help/answer others' questions on R/Py programming, shell scripting, version controlling, or anything else that's general and not project-specific. Use the corresponding `#proj-x` channels for all project-related questions.

Check out the Slack tips in the pinned posts in [#help-](https://jravilab.slack.com/archives/CATMCKFT9)proj_management to get oriented since you are new to Slack (the channel used to be `#howto-slack`)!

To re-familiarize yourself with R/Python/Unix, check out these two resources in addition to Slack \| [CompBio gists](https://github.com/jananiravi/compbio-gists) and [R-Ladies East Lansing](https://github.com/rladies-eastlansing). If you are new to R-Ladies Aurora, R-Ladies East Lansing, and Women+ Data Science, check them out and join [Meetup-RLA](https://meetup.com/rladies-aurora)/[Meetup-RLEL](https://meetup.com/rladies-eastlansing) and their [Discord](https://bit.ly/rladies-aurora-discord)/[Slack](https://rladies-eastlansing.slack.com/) to remain apprised of upcoming events and to connect with the local R and data science communities.

ðŸ’¡*If you find other useful resources, please add them to [this list](https://github.com/jananiravi/compbio-gists) (or share them with me).*

## Learn R

To learn R, I would recommend getting started with the pinned posts in [#courses-primers](https://jravilab.slack.com/archives/CARJ72W3U).

## Remote server work (JRaviLab server & Alpine HPC)

For computing that requires high performance hardware and computing clusters, we utilize two different remote servers.

### JRaviLab server

- A single high performance machine used only by our group.
- To request access, contact the system administrator `shaddai.amolitos@cuanschutz.edu` by sending him your CU username (e.g., the CU auto-generated `ravijan` instead of `janani.ravi@cuanschutz.edu`) and a brief message that you will need access to the server. CC janani.ravi@cuanschutz.edu, so they can both verify your access.
- If you are new to remote server work, then it maybe helpful to learn about using an [ssh config](https://linuxize.com/post/using-the-ssh-config-file/) for managing your remote hosts.

### Alpine HPC

- Alpine is the HPC cluster for all the University of Colorado campuses, including Anschutz.
- There is extensive [documentation about getting setup](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clusters/alpine/index.html)
- At the moment, a [web shell](https://ondemand-rmacc.rc.colorado.edu/pun/sys/shell/ssh/default) is the only access option for Anschutz members. This is different from a typical SSH login, and it is best to follow the official, latest Alpine documentation.

Whenver possible, we highly recommend using the [VSCode extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) which provides an IDE on the remote host without having to worry about server-side installation of other IDEs like RStudio or Jupyter.
