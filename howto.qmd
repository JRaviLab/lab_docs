# How to X \| Learning Resources

## Get started

If you are new to computational biology and R programming, join the `#bioinfo-bootcamp` channel. Use the `#how-to-x` channels to ask for help/answer others' questions on R/Py programming, shell scripting, version controlling, or anything else that's general and not project-specific. Use the corresponding `#proj-x` channels for all project-related questions.

Check out the Slack tips in the pinned posts in [#how-to-git](https://jravilab.slack.com/archives/CATMCKFT9) to get oriented since you are new to Slack. The channel used to be #how-to-slack!

To re-familiarize yourself with R/Python/Unix, check out these two resources in addition to Slack \| [CompBio gists](https://github.com/jananiravi/compbio-gists) and [R-Ladies East Lansing](https://github.com/rladies-eastlansing). If you are new to R-Ladies East Lansing and Women+ Data Science, check them out and join [Meetup](https://meetup.com/rladies-eastlansing) and their [Slack](https://rladies-eastlansing.slack.com/) to remain apprised of upcoming events and to connect with the local R and data science communities.

ðŸ’¡*If you find other useful resources, please add them to [this list](https://github.com/jananiravi/compbio-gists) (or share them with me).*

## Learn R

To learn R, I would recommend getting started with the pinned posts in [#courses-primers](https://jravilab.slack.com/archives/CARJ72W3U).

A couple of helpful GitHub repositories - <https://github.com/jananiravi/workshop-tidyverse> (Intro to `R's tidyverse package` --- very useful to learn right away) - Other R workshop materials from our R-Ladies East Lansing chapter: <https://github.com/rladies-eastlansing> - Interactive tutorials with [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) & [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/). - [R for Genomics from Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/R-genomics/index.html) - [R on HPC](https://github.com/JRaviLab/group/tree/master/resources-courses/r-on-hpc)
