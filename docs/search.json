All our conversations & every last bit of science get done here! :) So, please install this on your desktops (phones) and turn on notifications during working hours, whenever that is!\nIf you haven‚Äôt already, please create a professional GitHub account (e.g., jananiravi) with your full name. Once you pass that along to us, we will add you to the JRaviLab GitHub organization. Also, a neat memorable username will give you the opportunity to host your own webpage (e.g., jravilab.github.io or jananiravi.github.io). Our group repo is here.\nIf you have officially joined us as a grad or postdoc, or undergrad for 3/6+ months, you will automatically get added to our group webpage. If not, please check a few sample pages and furnish me with those details ‚Äì I can add you there right away. Also, we use Twitter for professional networking & announcements (connecting with the broader scientific/R/technical communities). If you have a Twitter handle, share it with me (DM), or follow #auto-twitter for updates. You can check out/follow a few accounts maintained by us: JRaviLab | my handle | RLadies-EastLansing | Women+ Data Science | AsiaR | ISMB EvolCompGen COSI. Thanks to recent interesting changes at Twitter, people have been migrating to Mastodon (e.g., genomic.social, fosstodon)!\nIf you would like to co-maintain any of these accounts or our webpage, please DM me. I‚Äôm always looking for volunteers! :)"
