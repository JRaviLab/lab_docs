Welcome to JRaviLab! We are excited that you are here --- as a student,
postdoc, or a visiting researcher! We have a number of resources
available in this short e-book and on Slack. Please take the time to
check these out. As you read them, if something is unclear, please feel
free to reach out to the group anytime.

Once you are done with the `familiarizing' and getting to know step,
please send me (JR) a message on Slack. Please bring your questions,
thoughts, feedback to the meeting.

Good luck \& welcome aboard! üéâ

\hypertarget{slack}{%
\chapter{Slack}\label{slack}}

Since our lab runs on \href{https://jravilab.slack.com}{Slack}, let's
first get you on there. All our conversations \& every last bit of
science gets done here! :) So, please install this on your desktops
(phones) and turn on notifications during working hours, whenever that
is!

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%
\section{Getting started}\label{getting-started}}

When you join, please introduce yourself in \texttt{\#general}. Tell us
a little about yourself here --- where you are from, what are your
interests -- science-wise or otherwise, why are you interested in
working with us, and in what capacity you'll be joining us.

I've never used Slack -\/- where do I even start? Maybe you can start
with the
\href{https://github.com/JRaviLab/cheatsheets/blob/master/slack-misc/slack-cheatsheet.pdf}{Slack
cheatsheet} and
\href{https://slack.com/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts}{Keyboard
shortcuts}.

\hypertarget{what-next}{%
\section{What next?}\label{what-next}}

Next, you can join the different channels to participate in various
kinds of conversations with the group --- look at the channel
description, check out the pinned messages of the channel, and dive
right in! Here are a few examples.

Finally, you will be invited to specific project channels (based on the
primary and secondary projects you will be working on). Based on chats
with your colleagues, if you'd like to contribute to/give feedback to
other projects, feel free to join those channels too.

\hypertarget{meet-the-group}{%
\section{Meet the group}\label{meet-the-group}}

You may have briefly spoken to a few group members prior to joining. I
urge you to take the first first weeks to introduce yourself to the
group members and chat with them (via Slack or over coffee/tea) to find
out what they are up to and learn a bit about the lab.

\bookmarksetup{startatroot}

\hypertarget{github}{%
\chapter{GitHub}\label{github}}

If you haven't already, please create a professional GitHub account
(\emph{e.g.,} \texttt{jananiravi}). Once you pass that along to us, we
will you add you to the \href{https://github.com/jravilab}{JRaviLab
GitHub organization}. Also, a neat memorable username will give you the
opportunity to host your own webpage (\emph{e.g.,}
\texttt{jravilab.github.io} or \texttt{jananiravi.github.io}). Our group
repo is
\href{https://github.com/JRaviLab/group/tree/master/meetings}{here}.

\bookmarksetup{startatroot}

\hypertarget{social-media}{%
\chapter{Social media}\label{social-media}}

If you have officially joined us as a grad or postdoc, or an undergrad
for 3/6+ months, you will automatically get added to our
\href{https://jravilab.github.io/\#people}{group webpage}. If not,
please check a few sample pages and furnish me with those details -- I
can add you there right away. Also, we use Twitter for professional
networking \& announcements (connecting with the broader
scientific/R/technical communities). If you have a Twitter handle, share
it with me (DM), or follow \#auto-twitter for updates. You can check
out/follow a few accounts maintained by us:
\href{https://twitter.com/jravilab}{JRaviLab} \textbar{}

\section{Get started}\label{get-started}}

If you are new to computational biology and R programming, join the
\texttt{\#bioinfo-bootcamp} channel. Use the \texttt{\#how-to-x}
channels to ask for help/answer others' questions on R/Py programming,
shell scripting, version controlling, or anything else that's general
and not project-specific. Use the corresponding \texttt{\#proj-x}
channels for all project-related questions.

Check out the Slack tips in the pinned posts in
\href{https://jravilab.slack.com/archives/CATMCKFT9}{\#how-to-git} to
get oriented since you are new to Slack. The channel used to be
\#how-to-slack!

To re-familiarize yourself with R/Python/Unix, check out these two
resources in addition to Slack \textbar{}
\href{https://github.com/jananiravi/compbio-gists}{CompBio gists} and
\href{https://github.com/rladies-eastlansing}{R-Ladies East Lansing}. If
you are new to R-Ladies East Lansing and Women+ Data Science, check them
out and join \href{https://meetup.com/rladies-eastlansing}{Meetup} and
their \href{https://rladies-eastlansing.slack.com/}{Slack} to remain
apprised of upcoming events and to connect with the local R and data
science communities.

them with me).}
