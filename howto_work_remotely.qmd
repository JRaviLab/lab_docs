# Remote Work

*updated during/due to the COVID-19 pandemic.*

# Few generic tips

1.  Focus on health -- physical and mental
2.  Setting goals & planning a 'tight' schedule
3.  Figure out what's accomplished and what not on a weekly basis & start the process over
4.  Find accountability partners
5.  Maintain good contact with me and the group
6.  Relax and meditate! \[my audible/kindle account details are shared via Slack\]

# #WorkFromHome tips

\~ Most tips may also be applicable to your coursework.

## 1. Daily Scrum

At the beginning of each day you're working, think or write down the following:

1.  What did you do yesterday? \["Yesterday, I ..."\]
2.  What will you do today? \["Today, I'm going to ..."\]
3.  Are there any impediments in your way?

## 2. Casual Co-work

Members are encouraged to setup co-work times to co-write, for code review, or just to work! (based off our most recent When2meet poll)

## 3. Finding time to chat with me

Finally, as a substitute for scheduling in-person meetings via Slack, I've made my full calendar available [here](http://bit.ly/janani-cucal), where you can easily fix a time to chat.

-   No need to ping me ahead.
-   No need to have a specific purpose/agenda, although this might help me prepare if it's for a scientific/technical check-in. We can talk about anything -- research, courses, work-life, home-life -- or just say "Hi!" ðŸ™‚
-   Pick a corresponding slot -- 15min, 30min, or 1h.
