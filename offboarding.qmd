# Offboarding

We are aware that career plans change, and that is perfectly ok. The Ravi lab always encourages you to pursue your future endeavors and dreams. Ensure you do your best to make Janani aware of any changes in your career plans so the offboarding process can run smoothly. 

## Ready to head out?

We are delighted to have been a part of your research life. We wish you great laurels as you move on to the next phase of your career.

Please make sure you have checked these boxes before leaving our group.

-   [ ] Please return any devices, cords, or computers that belong to the lab.

-   [ ] All your code is on GitHub

-   [ ] All your processed data files/figures/reports (\<100mb) are on GitHub

-   [ ] Large data files (raw/processed) are on the server (and backed up)

-   [ ] All your scripts and data files are well-annotated with appropriate `README` files

-   [ ] Added detailed status report of where things -- what was tried, what worked/didn't work, where the scripts/data files are, what remains to be done (within the scope of the project, and clear next steps)

-   [ ] You have reoriented me and at least 1-2 other project members with the precise status (and next steps) of the project and the location of files

-   [ ] You are not a full member of our GitHub organization, Slack workspace, Google Drive, or Outlook Calendar anymore but will retain access to the project channel/repo until publication (or complete transition to other project members).

-   [ ] If you are switching from being a full member to a collaborator, you will now only have collaborator privileges on Slack, GitHub, and Google Drive, until you are done with the project/your term with the collaborator.

-   [ ] If you have worked with us for a considerable period of time, you will remain a part of `#the-continuum` channel on our Slack.

-   [ ] Leave and update us of any changes in contact information for authorship purposes in case we need to reach you and add you to the list of authors for all the work you contributed to the published project.
