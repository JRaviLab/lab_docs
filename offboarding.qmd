We are delighted to have been a part of your research life. We wish you great laurels as you move on to the next phase of your career.

Please make sure you have checked these boxes before leaving our group.

-   [ ] All your processed data files/figures/reports (\<100mb) are on GitHub

-   [ ] Large data files (raw/processed) are on the server (and backed up)

-   [ ] All your scripts and data files are well-annotated with appropriate `README` files

-   [ ] Added detailed status report of where things -- what was tried, what worked/didn't work, where the scripts/data files are, what remains to be done (within the scope of the project, and clear next steps)

-   [ ] You have reoriented me and at least 1-2 other project members with the precise status (and next steps) of the project and location of files

-   [ ] You are not a full member of the GitHub organization or Slack anymore but will retain access to the project channel/repo until publication.

-   [ ] If you have worked with us for â‰¥3mo, you will remain a part of `#the-continuum` channel on our Slack.

Good luck!
