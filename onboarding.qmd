# Onboarding

Welcome to JRaviLab! We are excited that you are here --- as a student, postdoc, or a visiting researcher! We have a number of resources available in this short e-book and on Slack. Please take the time to check these out. As you read them, if something is unclear, please feel free to reach out to the group anytime.

Once you are done with the 'familiarizing' and getting to know step, please send me (JR) a message on Slack. Please bring your questions, thoughts, feedback to the meeting.

Good luck & welcome aboard! ðŸŽ‰

# Slack
Since our lab runs on [Slack](https://jravilab.slack.com), let's first get you on there. All our conversations & every last bit of science gets done here! :) So, please install this on your desktops (phones) and turn on notifications during working hours, whenever that is!

## Getting started
When you join, please introduce yourself in `#general`. Tell us a little about yourself here --- where you are from, what are your interests -- science-wise or otherwise, why are you interested in working with us, and in what capacity you'll be joining us.

I've never used Slack \-- where do I even start? Maybe you can start with the [Slack cheatsheet](https://github.com/JRaviLab/cheatsheets/blob/master/slack-misc/slack-cheatsheet.pdf) and [Keyboard shortcuts](https://slack.com/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts).

## What next?
Next, you can join the different channels to participate in various kinds of conversations with the group --- look at the channel description, check out the pinned messages of the channel, and dive right in! Here are a few examples.

Finally, you will be invited to specific project channels (based on the primary and secondary projects you will be working on). Based on chats with your colleagues, if you'd like to contribute to/give feedback to other projects, feel free to join those channels too.

## Meet the group

You may have briefly spoken to a few group members prior to joining. I urge you to take the first first weeks to introduce yourself to the group members and chat with them (via Slack or over coffee/tea) to find out what they are up to and learn a bit about the lab. 

# GitHub
If you haven't already, please create a professional GitHub account (*e.g.,* `jananiravi`). Once you pass that along to us, we will you add you to the [JRaviLab GitHub organization](https://github.com/jravilab). Also, a neat memorable username will give you the opportunity to host your own webpage (*e.g.,* `jravilab.github.io` or `jananiravi.github.io`). Our group repo is [here](https://github.com/JRaviLab/group/tree/master/meetings).

# Social media
If you have officially joined us as a grad or postdoc, or an undergrad for 3/6+ months, you will automatically get added to our [group webpage](https://jravilab.github.io/#people). If not, please check a few sample pages and furnish me with those details -- I can add you there right away. Also, we use Twitter for professional networking & announcements (connecting with the broader scientific/R/technical communities). If you have a Twitter handle, share it with me (DM), or follow #auto-twitter for updates. You can check out/follow a few accounts maintained by us: [JRaviLab](https://twitter.com/jravilab) | [my handle](https://twitter.com/janani137) | [RLadies-EastLansing](https://twitter.com/rladies-eastlansing) | [Women+ Data Science](https://twitter.com/womenplusdata) | [AsiaR](https://twitter.com/AsiaR-comm) | [ISMB's EvolCompGen COSI](https://twitter.com/EvolComp).

If you would like to co-maintain any of these accounts/webpage, please DM me. I'm always looking for volunteers! :)
